## Introduction

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Makefiles and their role in compiling C programs. Each task in this repository focuses on different aspects of Makefiles, such as creating rules, using variables, and managing dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/makefile-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd makefile-project
```

3. Explore the various task directories, each containing a Makefile and relevant C files.

## Usage

For each task, navigate to the respective directory and use the `make` command along with the `-f` flag to specify the Makefile you want to use. For example:

```bash
make -f 0-Makefile
```

This will execute the Makefile and build the corresponding executable.

## Task Descriptions

1. **0. make -f 0-Makefile:** Create your first Makefile. This task demonstrates the basic structure of a Makefile and how to compile C files into an executable.

2. **1. make -f 1-Makefile:** Enhance your Makefile with variables. Learn how to use variables to improve the readability and maintainability of your Makefile.

3. **2. make -f 2-Makefile:** Create your first useful Makefile. Explore how to compile multiple source files and manage dependencies between them.

4. **3. make -f 3-Makefile:** Develop a complete Makefile. Learn advanced Makefile techniques such as clean, fclean, and re rules, as well as how to handle compiler flags.

5. **4. A complete Makefile:** Create a Makefile with additional features. This task builds upon the previous one and refines the Makefile even further.

6. **5. Island Perimeter:** Implement a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island represented by a grid.

7. **6. make -f 100-Makefile (Advanced):** Create an advanced Makefile with additional restrictions and optimizations.

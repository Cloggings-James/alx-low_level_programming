/*
 * 101-O - Time Complexity of Jump Search
 *
 * The time complexity of Jump Search in the average case, using a step size of sqrt(n),
 * is approximately O(√n), where 'n' is the size of the array.
 *
 * Jump Search is an algorithm that divides the array into blocks of size sqrt(n)
 * and performs a linear search within the block where the value might be located.
 * On average, it performs a constant number of operations proportional to the square root of the number of elements in the array.
 *
 * This makes the average time complexity of Jump Search O(√n).
